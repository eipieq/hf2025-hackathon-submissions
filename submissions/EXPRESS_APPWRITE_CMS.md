## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

This summer, one of my uncles wanted a website for his business. Since he isn't very tech-savvy, wanted to make sure they could manage everything easily without needing me to add or edit products every time. So, built the website along with a simple CMS powered by Appwrite. It was my first version, quite amateur and built with plain JavaScript.

After running into several issues along the way, decided to rebuild the whole thing using Next.js and create a much more flexible CMS with Express. When I showed it to my uncle, he said it was a 1000 times better than the first one. Thought why not make this available for anyone building with Appwrite?
